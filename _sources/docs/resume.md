" Be a creator not a programmer. "

Hello, my name is Hyunwoong Ko. I graduated from Chonbuk University majoring in Software Engineering and am currently working as an AI Research Engineer at Kakao Brain. My dream is to be a creator who makes great software. I hope that the software I've created will give many people hope and help those in need.
