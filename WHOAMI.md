## 5. Skills and Experiences
1. Language model pre-training
    - I've been training 5+ pre-trained models such as TUNiB-GPT, TUNiB-Electra and Polyglot.
2. Prompt programming
    - I've been writing all of prompts used in BLOONY.
    - I've been writing almost all prompts used for autonomous data generation used at TUNiB.
3. Generative modeling
    - I made many generative models on Pororo library such as Translation, Summarization, Question generation and Pharaprase generation.
    - I've been making all of generative chatbot models of TUNiB such as Coco, Mas and BLOONY.
    - I've been making TUNiB N행시 models which are very popular in the Korean internet community.
4. Korean language processing
    - I've been making Kss, the most famous Korean sentence segmentation library.
    - I also made Pecab, pure python Korean morpheme analyzer based on Mecab-ko-dic.
5. Data crawling & collection
    - I crawled 1.2TB of Korean text data from web to make TUNiB-GPT.
    - I am building 10+TB of Multilingual text dataset to make Polyglot.
6. Distributed Processing
    - I've been building almost all deep learining parallelization mechanism from scratch on Parallelformers and OSLO project.
    - I co-worked with HF 3D Parallelism team and Microsoft DeepSpeed team.
    - I've been contributing to several famous libraries such as Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed.
7. Cluster orchestration and server operating
    - I've been deploying almost all TUNiB models using AWS ECS, especially the number of daily request of TUNiB N행시 was 2,000,000.
    - I used pre-built EKS cluster in EleutherAI and currently studying K8S and EKS.
    - I've been also using Slurm launcher well in EleutherAI.
8. Kernel optimization
    - I have deploying almost all TUNiB models with TensorRT, ONNX and DeepSpeed Inference.
    - I also have an experience of making Torchscript based compiler with PyTorch team.
9. Backend server programming
    - I've been making almost all backend servers of TUNiB models using FastAPI.
    - I've been made BLOONY backend server using Java Spring , currently migrated to FastAPI at TUNiB.
