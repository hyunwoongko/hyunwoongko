## 6. Skills and Experiences
1. **Language Model Pre-training**
    - I've been pre-training 5+ models such as TUNiB-GPT, TUNiB-Electra and Polyglot.
2. **Prompt Programming**
    - I've been writing all prompts used in BLOONY.
    - I've been writing almost all prompts used for autonomous data generation used at TUNiB.
3. **Generative Language Modeling**
    - I made many generative models in Pororo such as Translation, Summarization, Question generation and Pharaprase generation.
    - I did resarches about Korean quiz generation modeling at Kakaobrain.
    - I've been making all generative chatbot models of TUNiB such as Coco, Mas and BLOONY.
    - I've been making TUNiB N행시 models which are very popular in the Korean internet community.
4. **Korean Language Processing**
    - I've been making Kss, the most famous Korean sentence segmentation library.
    - I also made Pecab, pure python Korean morpheme analyzer based on Mecab-ko-dic.
5. **Data Crawling & Collection**
    - I crawled 1.2TB of Korean text data from web to make TUNiB-GPT.
    - I am building 10+TB of Multilingual text dataset to make Polyglot.
    - I enjoy to use the two techniques for crawling: backend crawling and offline parsing.
6. **Distributed Processing**
    - I've been building almost all deep learining parallelization mechanism from scratch on Parallelformers and OSLO project.
    - I co-worked with HF 3D Parallelism team and Microsoft DeepSpeed team.
    - I've been contributing to several famous libraries such as Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed.
7. **Cluster Orchestration and Server Operating**
    - I've been deploying almost all TUNiB models using AWS ECS, especially the number of daily request of TUNiB N행시 was 2,000,000.
    - I've built k8s cluster on GKE for model evalauation in KakaoBrain.
    - I've been using Slurm launcher well in EleutherAI.
8. **Kernel Optimization**
    - I have deploying almost all TUNiB models with TensorRT, ONNX and DeepSpeed Inference.
    - I also have an experience of making Torchscript based compiler with PyTorch team.
9. **Backend Server Programming**
    - I've been making almost all backend servers of TUNiB models using FastAPI.
    - I've been made BLOONY backend server using Java Spring , but currently migrated to FastAPI at TUNiB.
